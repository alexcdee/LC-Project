# LC-Project
My LC Project
This is my project for my Leaving Cert Computer Science.
It is applied to enchance some aspect of health and wellbeing in people's lives.
I have chosen a Step Tracker with the MicroBit V2.
  - It comes with the Step Tracker feautre and a light sensor which can be used to determine if light levels
    affects people's step levels throughout their walk.
